HelpDeskUtilities
=================

A tool to automate simple tasks that regularly need to be performed at the NMU HelpDesk.

The major goal of this application is to automate tasks that are performed fairly often and generally do not
require much debugging. The design aims to be intuitive and simple to jump into, but allow for a certain
level of advanced debugging.

It should also function as a learning tool for the programmer to cover several tools/technologies new to him/her.
